Multivariate Nornal Code
------------------------

Part 0: Data Input and Sufficient Statistics Computations
Part 1: Elicitation of the Prior 
        - user needs to provide inputs for the elicitation
Part 2: Sampling from the prior 
        - user needs to input Monte Carlo sample size Nprior and program uses output from Part 2 
Part 3: Sampling from the Importance Sampler for Posterior Calculations 
        - user needs to input Monte Carlo sample size Npostimp and program uses output from Part 1
Part 4: SIR Algorithm to Approximately Sample from the Posterior 
        - user needs to input Monte Carlo sample size Npost and progam uses output from Part 3
        - this is not essential for any of the other calculations
Part 5: Calculating the Prior Density, Posterior Density and Relative Belief Ratio for the Parameter of Interest psi 
        - program uses output from Parts 2 and 3 and user needs to interact with the program
          to determine the number of cells used for the density estimation (numcells) and the
          amount of smoothing mprior for the prior and mpost for the posterior
Part 6. Inferences for psi
        - uses output from Part 5
